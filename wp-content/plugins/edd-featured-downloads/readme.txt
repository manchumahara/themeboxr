Easily feature your downloads

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). It's aimed at developers/clients who need to show a list of featured downloads.

1. Provides a template tag so finely-tuned placement of featured downloads in your theme is possible.
1. Provides a shortcode which will simply list all the featured downloads, without the need to enter any IDs.
1. Provides a simple interface for managing featured downloads in the WordPress admin. A "feature download" checkbox will be added to each download edit/publish screen as well as the quick edit boxes. At a glance you'll also be able to see which downloads have been featured on your website from the main download listing.

= Shortcode Usage =

Add the "featured" attribute to the existing [downloads] shortcode provided by Easy Digital Downloads:

    [downloads featured="yes"]

= Template Tag Usage =

The following template tag is available for showing the featured downloads anywhere in your theme.

    if( function_exists( 'edd_fd_show_featured_downloads') ) {
	    edd_fd_show_featured_downloads();
    }

The template tag uses the exact same HTML as the shortcode so can be modified accordingly by overriding the EDD templates.

= Building your own Query =

To build your own query using [WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query "WP_Query") you can use the `meta_key` parameter with a value of `edd_feature_download`. The following example builds a simple unordered list with all the featured downloads.

    <?php

    $args = array(
	    'post_type' => 'download',
	    'meta_key'  => 'edd_feature_download',
    );

    $featured_downloads = new WP_Query( $args );

    if( $featured_downloads->have_posts() ) : ?>

	    <ul>
		    <?php while( $featured_downloads->have_posts() ) : $featured_downloads->the_post(); ?>
		    <li>
		       <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title(); ?>">
		            <?php the_title(); ?>
		       </a>
		    </li>
		    <?php endwhile; ?>
	    </ul>

    <?php endif; wp_reset_postdata(); ?>

== Installation ==

1. Upload entire `edd-featured-downloads` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
